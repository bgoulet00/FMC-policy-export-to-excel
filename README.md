# FMC-policy-export-to-excel
Export Cisco FMC access control policy to excel sheet

This script will generate an excel xlsx file dump of a Cisco FMC access control policy.
The output is meant to be a reference of the policy that appears similar in layout to the web GUI.
The output is NOT suitable or intended to be a backup of the policy.
Additionally, Users, Source Dynamic Attribute and Destination Dynamic Attribute are not accounted for but
updates to include those items should be trivial if you use those technologies.
